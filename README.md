# Blackjack

Blackjack is the most popular table game of casino games. It is very popular with foreign casinos and online casinos. The basics of Blackjack's rules are simple: casino dealers deal cards to themselves and players, and the game with the total number of hands close to "21" wins. As such, the rules themselves are simple, but they are also deep games in which the outcome is divided by how much you can read the waves.
